**WARNING**: This crate has been renamed to `dxr` as of version 0.6.0.

The dxr project provides crates for writing XML-RPC API clients and servers in Rust.

This crate contains implementations of type conversions between XML strings, XML-RPC values, and
the corresponding Rust types. This functionality should be considered an internal implementation
detail, and never be imported or used directly.
